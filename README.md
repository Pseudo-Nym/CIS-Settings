CIS Settings

## CIS settings for Mac (10.9 and 10.10)

This is an attempt at checking off the list for CIS Level 1 settings on an OS X installation via BASH

Several lines do not work and have been commented out. Certain one's will hose a system. Left in the script for reference.

**Use at your own risk, please. There may be dragons.**

The El Capitan file is in current development based off 1.0 Benchmark.

The Yosemite file is experimental and not based on published benchmarks from CIS.

The Mavericks file is mostly ready, but not very pretty. The benchmark is available at the [Center for Internet Security] (https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/)
