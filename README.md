CIS Settings

## CIS settings for Mac (10.9 and 10.10)

This is an attempt at checking off the list for CIS Level 1 settings on an OS X installation via BASH

Several lines do not work and have been commented out. Certain one's will hose a system. Left in the script for reference.

**Use at your own risk, please. There may be dragons.**

The Yosemite dotfile is experimental and not based on published benchmarks from CIS.

The Mavericks dotfile is mostly ready, but not very pretty. The benchmark is available at the [Center for Internet Security] (https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/)
